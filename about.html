    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Akshata â€” a passionate tech enthusiast who loves creating things that are both functional and beautiful. I'm currently diving deep into web development and natural language processing, with a soft spot for transformer models and UI/UX design âœ¨</p>

    <p>Whether it's coding up a cute calculator or analyzing 200K+ reviews with BERT, I find joy in blending logic with creativity. My dream is to work on projects that make people's digital experiences smoother, more intuitive, and totally unforgettable ðŸ’–</p>

    <p>I believe in the power of clean design, accessible interfaces, and technology that genuinely helps people. With a strong interest in user empathy, I aim to bridge the gap between humans and machines through thoughtful design and efficient code.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding or sketching out wireframes, you'll probably find me binge-watching UX case studies, organizing my Notion workspace, or dreaming up my next personal project. I'm always excited to learn, experiment, and grow in this ever-evolving field ðŸ’»ðŸŒ¸</p>
